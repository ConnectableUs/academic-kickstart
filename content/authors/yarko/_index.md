I have been programming,
starting with FORTRAN (1968),
C (1979),
and Python (1999).
Before Python, I disliked perl, and liked Icon, ksh, awk (awkcc).

Besides coding, I've been interested
in
team processes
and
architectural methods.

I have worked with psychologists for over 25 years in team dynamics
and skills.
I received a Motorola award for a
formal technical review program delivered to more than 1,000 engineers
whose core was team skills.
Not surprisingly, systems architecture also involves
clear, careful communmication with the problem space.
Around the time Agile was getting started, I ran a team using
an architectural pattern based on team skills, but applied
to systems.

From 2008 to 2016 I was an organizer
of PyCon, the U.S. national Python conference.
As PyCon Volunteer Coordinator, I encouraged and watched positive
community interaction take hold.

I am a recipient of 2010 Python Community Service Award,
and occasional open source contributor.

In technology, I've worked on commercial UNIX kernels,
POSIX standardization,
communications equipment, and mobile devices
at Unisys, Bell Labs, Motorola, University of Chicago,
and a few other places.

I have a BSEC in Computer Engineering from the University of Arizona,
when Dr. Gerald Petersen was developing a hardware description language.
As an undergraduate, I ran a Unix V6 lab for classes and
research.

I got into engineering as an escapee from a Bio major,
and a summer turned 6 years at an auto parts store
and working on pit crews.
I ride a motorcycle.
